"""Ranking Whisper's guesses below real lyrics, without discarding them.

Einstuerzende Neubauten's "Installation N deg 1" is stored as
"HerausforderDisobeylarationDisobeyedzyIt's the lawczywiscieDisobey not" --
German and Polish fragments fused without spaces, from a track that is mostly
industrial noise. It is fun, and it is not the words.

The distinction that matters: 69 tracks have Whisper's own *text*, while 94 have
``whisper_aligned`` where the words came from a real source and only the
timings are Whisper's. Penalising the second set would be wrong.
