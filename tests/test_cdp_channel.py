"""The CDP connection must not strand threads, because quitting joins them.

Every command used to get a fresh thread running ``asyncio.run``, joined with
a timeout and then abandoned if it overran. :func:`browser_playback` runs off a
two-second timer, so a browser that answered slowly leaked one thread -- each
holding a live event loop -- per tick. A live TUI was found with 46 of them.

The cost lands at exit. Shutdown joins the executors, and anyio's replacement
for ``_shutdown_default_executor`` ends in a bare ``thread.join()`` with no
timeout, so CPython's 300-second cap expires, prints its warning, and then the
process blocks for good.

These tests hold the shape of the fix: one thread serving every call, and no
new thread when a call gives up.
