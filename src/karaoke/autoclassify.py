"""Fill in a track's genre and tone when it has neither, without being asked.

Both labels existed only where someone had done something: genre from pressing
`k` or from a bulk script, tone from a bulk script. So a track played for the
first time stayed unlabelled indefinitely, which is exactly the track a listener
is looking at.

**What it will and will not do is decided by cost.**

- *Tone* is free: the lyrics are already in the database and the sentence
  embedding is already loaded for lyric search, so it runs on any track with
  real words and no stored tone.
- *Genre* needs audio. Where a CLAP embedding exists, or the audio is already
  in the cache, that is a few seconds in a worker and it runs. Where it is not
  -- a Spotify track with nothing downloadable -- the only way to get audio is
  to **record 45 seconds of it**, and starting a recording because a song came
  on is not something a program should decide by itself. `k` stays the way to
  ask for that.

Never re-labels. A stored label is a decision, and quietly replacing it on
every play would make the library unstable in a way nobody asked for; the bulk
scripts take `--overwrite` for when a re-label is actually wanted.
