"""Active desktop-player detection and mode selection for the karaoke TUI.

The TUI's default is to watch whatever is playing on the desktop (via MPRIS /
playerctl) and pick a mode automatically:

- ``spotify``  — a Spotify player is active; sync/control that.
- ``scan``     — a desktop/browser player is playing (e.g. a YouTube / YT Music
                 tab in Firefox/Chrome, or VLC); sync lyrics to its position.
- ``browse``   — nothing is playing; the user drives the library list and
                 opening a song launches the browser (the old "youtube mode").

Browser MPRIS metadata is unreliable, so when a source URL is present we prefer
looking the track up by URL in the local ``sources`` table (see the
karaoke-app-development skill) before trusting artist/title.
