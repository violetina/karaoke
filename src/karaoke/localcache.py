"""Cluster-independent local cache + play/discovery stats (SQLite).

The OpenSearch index on the kind cluster is the rich search/index store, but it
is only available when the cluster is running. This module adds a small, always-
available SQLite database (``~/.local/share/karaoke/karaoke.db`` by default) that:

- Caches lyrics and track metadata.
- Records every play/identification event so ``karaoke-stats`` can report play
  counts, top artists, and radio-discovery stats.
