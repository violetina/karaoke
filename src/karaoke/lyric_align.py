"""Lay real lyrics onto Whisper's rhythm.

Whisper on sung audio is a poor transcriber and a good metronome. It mishears
words ("up to do" -> "up to doom", "daddy done" -> "daddy John") and emits
"🎵" / "// Music //" artifacts, but the *times* it attaches to what it heard are
close to right.

So Whisper supplies timing and a known-good source (LRCLIB, Genius) supplies
words. The two cannot simply be zipped: Whisper's line breaks fall in different
places from the real lyric's, and it drops or invents whole phrases.

    whisper: [00:21.24] mister, when you're gone 🎵 🎵They bring you
    real:    Where, mister, when you're young / They bring you up to do

Instead both are reduced to normalized word streams and aligned with
``difflib.SequenceMatcher``, which anchors on the words Whisper *did* get right
("valley", "high school", "seventeen") and tolerates the rest as edits. Each
real line takes the timestamp of its earliest anchored word; unanchored lines
are interpolated between their neighbours so no line is left without a time.

stdlib only — no alignment dependency is pulled in for this.

    Interpolation is only as good as the anchors it runs between. Across a
    short gap it is reliable; across a long one it is a guess dressed as a
    measurement -- on GAUPA - Febersvan, anchors existed in the first 58s and
    after 337s of a 448-second track, and the eleven lines interpolated across
    the 280-second middle came out up to 183 seconds wrong.

    That gap cannot be closed by matching harder. Whisper heard the vocal at
    the right moment and got the words wrong ("She'll turn" for "Our
    shelter"), and no character or phonetic similarity admits that pairing
    while rejecting "feel"/"fell" and "feel"/"feet", which sit at the same
    ratio and would manufacture false anchors in a song whose lyric is mostly
    the word "feel". So the honest move is to notice the drought and say so.
