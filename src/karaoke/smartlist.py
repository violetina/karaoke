"""Build a playlist from tracks that feel alike.

The library already knows what each song is *about*: ``visuals.analyze_sentiment``
turns a lyric block into a mood breakdown, and the analysis row carries tempo and
energy. This puts the two together to answer "more like this one" — seeded by a
track you are playing, or by a mood you are in.

Matching is on the **shape** of the sentiment, not the dominant label. Two songs
can both come out "sad" while one is purely mournful and the other is half
furious; comparing the whole vector keeps those apart, where comparing labels
would file them together.

Sentiment is recomputed on demand rather than stored. It costs about 0.2ms per
track — the whole library profiles in well under a second — and a cache would
only create a way for it to disagree with the lyrics it came from.
