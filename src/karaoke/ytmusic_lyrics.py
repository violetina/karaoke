"""Read the lyrics YouTube Music is already showing.

A track can be playing with its full lyrics on screen — the SONGTEKST tab,
attributed to LyricFind — while the library reports "no lyrics". LRCLIB does
not have every song, and YouTube captions are a different thing entirely
(a video's subtitle track, not the lyrics panel), so nothing in the pipeline
ever looked at what was in front of the user.

This reads that panel over the CDP connection the playback window already has
open for navigation. No new dependency, no API key, no scraping of anything
that is not already on screen.

Two limits worth stating plainly:

- **It only sees the track that is playing.** This is the open tab, not a
  service, so it cannot backfill a library on demand — it captures what is in
  front of you, when it is in front of you.
- **The text is unsynced.** LyricFind supplies words, not timings. That makes
  alignment against a transcription (:mod:`karaoke.lyric_align`) not an
  enhancement but the whole point: words from here, rhythm from Whisper.

The result is verified against the playing track before it is stored. The panel
lags a track change by a moment, and attributing one song's words to another is
the kind of mistake that is invisible afterwards.
