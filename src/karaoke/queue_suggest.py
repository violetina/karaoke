"""Suggest tracks that keep the vibe of a whole queue going.

Seeds on **every** track already in the queue rather than one, so the result
reflects the set's shared character instead of lurching toward whatever the last
song was. Each seed contributes its nearest neighbours (by sound), the neighbours
are pooled, and a track that is close to *several* queue members outranks one that
merely resembles a single outlier.

Similarity comes from the audio vectors, preferring CLAP (a learned timbre/genre
embedding) and falling back per-seed to the spectral vector when a track has no
CLAP embedding -- the same precedence :func:`karaoke.search.similar_main` uses.
This is query-by-example: it needs no lyrics, so it works for instrumentals too.
