"""Record mode: capture the output continuously and mark what is playing.

``karaoke-sample`` analyses one track at a time, in real time, on demand. This
is the unattended version: leave it running for an evening and it captures
everything coming out of the speakers while, in parallel, asking songrec every
so often what is playing.

Each identification is written as a **marker** — "at this wall-clock instant we
were N seconds into track X". :mod:`karaoke.recording_slice` turns those back
into a track list afterwards, which is what lets hours of audio be cut into
songs and analysed offline at full speed instead of one track per listen.

Two independent readers of the same monitor source is fine: PipeWire allows it,
so ffmpeg and songrec do not contend. The monitor is also a different device
from the microphone, so record mode composes with radio mode rather than
fighting it for an input.

The recording is a means to metadata, not a library. ``keep_audio`` is off by
default and the analysis worker deletes the audio once it has extracted what it
needs.
