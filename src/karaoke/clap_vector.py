"""Audio embeddings that share a space with text, via CLAP.

The hand-built vector in :mod:`karaoke.audio_vector` describes a track's
spectral shape, and measurement showed the limit of that: across 3000 random
pairs its cosine similarity ran a median of 0.965 with a p5-p95 spread of 0.10,
and mean-centring widened the spread fourteenfold *without reordering the
neighbours*. The narrow range was cosmetic; the features themselves put The
Cranberries next to Macy Gray.

CLAP is trained on audio paired with text, which buys two things that vector
cannot offer at any amount of tuning:

- **Neighbours that hold up.** Median similarity 0.779 with p5-p95 spanning
  0.59-0.91 — a real spread, arrived at without any centring trick.
- **Text queries over audio.** "heavy distorted guitar rock" returns Mastodon
  and Dinosaur Jr.; "electronic dance beat" returns Modjo and Boy Harsher.
  From a library the model has never seen, with no lyrics, tags or metadata
  involved. That matters most for instrumentals, which have no words to embed
  and were previously unreachable by any query at all.

No new package: torch and transformers are already installed. The weights are a
~600 MB download, cached by huggingface after the first use.

This does not replace the 62-dimension vector. That one is cheap, needs no
model, and stays useful for near-duplicate detection between two captures of
the same performance; this one is for "what does it sound like".
