"""Build a Spotify playlist from the karaoke-ready tracks in SQLite.

"Known songs" means tracks that carry approved *synced* lyrics — those are the
ones the player can actually run a karaoke session on, so they are what belongs
in the playlist.

Each track needs a Spotify URI. Stored ``sources`` rows of kind ``spotify``
already carry one; everything else is resolved through the Spotify search API,
which is where the misses come from (YouTube-only finds, obscure releases).

Run:  ``karaoke-spotify-playlist --dry-run``   to see what would be added
      ``karaoke-spotify-playlist``             to create/update the playlist
