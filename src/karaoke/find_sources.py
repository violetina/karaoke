"""Find a playable source for tracks that have lyrics but no URL.

Lyrics and sources arrive by different routes. Radio discovery and backfill
resolve a track by artist/title against LRCLIB, which fills in the *words* and
records no *URL*. Those tracks then look complete but cannot be played, and
post-processing cannot analyse them either — key/BPM needs the actual audio, so
the worker reports "no watchable URL" and drops the task.

This closes that gap: search YouTube per track and store the best match, using
the same verified picker the backfill uses so a wrong video is not saved.

Run:  ``karaoke-find-sources --dry-run``   to see what it would store
      ``karaoke-find-sources --limit 50``  to store them
