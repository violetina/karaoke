"""Cover art as coloured terminal cells.

The player usually has the artwork already: Chromium writes YouTube Music's
cover to a local file and advertises it over MPRIS as ``mpris:artUrl``, so
nothing has to be downloaded. The Spotify app does not — it advertises a remote
``https://i.scdn.co/...`` URL — so remote art is fetched once into a small
on-disk cache and used the same way. When there is no art at all but the
track's audio is in the YouTube cache, the first video frame stands in.

Decoding is delegated to ffmpeg, which is already required for downloads. That
avoids adding an image library and, more usefully, handles whatever the source
happens to be — PNG from MPRIS, JPEG or WebP from a thumbnail — without caring.

Each pixel is drawn as a SPACE with a background colour. A space is
unambiguously one cell wide, so unlike block or half-block characters the art
cannot shift by a column on a terminal that draws those glyphs wide.
