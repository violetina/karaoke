"""RabbitMQ consumer that runs deferred track post-processing.

Consumes tasks published by :mod:`karaoke.postprocess_queue` and, per track:

1. Ensures the audio is downloaded to the YouTube cache.
2. Runs key/BPM/energy analysis and stores it in ``track_analysis`` (if missing).
3. Upgrades line-level synced lyrics to Enhanced LRC word timing via YouTube
   json3 captions (if missing).

The queue is intentionally NON-persistent conceptually: if the broker is reset
we can simply re-enqueue from SQLite. A task is ACKed only once it completes;
a failure is requeued once and then dropped, so a crash re-delivers work while a
permanently-failing track cannot spin the worker in a redelivery loop.

Run:  ``karaoke-postprocess-worker``  (or ``python -m karaoke.postprocess_worker``)
Env:  RABBITMQ_HOST (default localhost), RABBITMQ_USER/PASS (default guest).
