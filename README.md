# karaoke

A local karaoke + lyric-search platform.

- **Scan** a music library (`~/Music`) and/or import your **Spotify** library as metadata.
- **Index** track metadata + lyrics into **OpenSearch** (with kNN vector search) on a local **kind** cluster.
- **Fetch** synced (timestamped) lyrics from **LRCLIB** (free, no key), cached in OpenSearch.
- **Karaoke** CLI: identify the current song (file / text / live via `songrec`), then render time-synced highlighted lyrics.
- **lyricsearch**: semantic "find the song that goes '...'" via lyric embeddings (sentence-transformers).
- **Whisper fallback**: for local files with no LRCLIB match, transcribe to approximate synced lyrics with faster-whisper.
- **Local cache + stats**: a cluster-independent SQLite store serves known songs' lyrics offline (checked before the cluster/LRCLIB) and records play/discovery stats for `karaoke-stats`.

## Source model (hybrid)

- `~/Music` = audio + cache source. Karaoke playback and Whisper transcription run here.
- Spotify (your account) = optional metadata seed (liked songs / playlists). Spotify's API does **not** allow audio download, so no Whisper for Spotify-only tracks; lyrics come from LRCLIB.
- Lyrics are cached in **two** places: the OpenSearch index (rich, on the kind cluster) and a **local SQLite cache** (`~/.local/share/karaoke/karaoke.db`) that works with no cluster. Lookups check the local cache first, then OpenSearch, then LRCLIB — so a known song replays fully offline.

## Layout

```
src/karaoke/        # the package
tests/              # pytest
deploy/             # kind + opensearch manifests
docs/               # MkDocs project documentation
```

## Safety

The scanner/deploy scripts **only** talk to the `kind-karaoke` kube-context. They abort if the current
context is not `kind-*`, so nothing can touch the AKS work clusters.

See the implementation plan: `~/.hermes/plans/2026-08-29_173500-local-karaoke-platform.md`.

## Dev quickstart

```bash
python3.14 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -v
```

## Usage

```bash
# Index a music library (tags -> LRCLIB lyrics -> embed -> OpenSearch)
music-index --dir ~/Music

# Semantic search: find a song by what its lyrics mean
lyricsearch "religion faith losing my belief"
lyricsearch --keyword "teen spirit"          # keyword mode

# Karaoke: synced, highlighted lyrics in the terminal
karaoke "R.E.M. - Losing My Religion"        # by name (uses cache/LRCLIB)
karaoke --file song.mp3                       # from a local file's tags
karaoke --file song.mp3 --transcribe          # Whisper fallback if no LRCLIB lyrics
karaoke --file song.mp3 --force-transcribe    # always transcribe (skip cache + LRCLIB)
karaoke --listen                              # identify room audio via mic (songrec), sync once
karaoke --radio                               # CONTINUOUS: follow live radio, re-lock as songs change
karaoke --output                              # identify audio playing on this machine
karaoke --youtube URL                         # karaoke a YouTube video (yt-dlp title -> lyrics)
karaoke --youtube URL --download              # + fetch audio so Whisper/beats can run
karaoke-yt URL                                # shorthand: URL is positional (no flag)
karaoke-yt URL -d --transcribe                # download + Whisper if no LRCLIB match
karaoke-yt --cache-status                     # show downloaded YouTube audio size
karaoke-yt --prune-cache 100                  # prune oldest downloads to <= 100 MiB
karaoke --print "Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody"  # just print the LRC, no live player
karaoke --spotify                             # lock lyrics to the LIVE Spotify position
karaoke --player                              # get current song from any desktop player (MPRIS)
```

## Stats

Every play/identification is recorded in the local cache. Report it with:

```bash
karaoke-stats            # plays, discoveries, top tracks/artists, per-mode, cache hit-rate
karaoke-stats --days 7   # only the last week
karaoke-stats --json     # machine-readable
make stats               # same summary via make
```

In `--radio` mode the stats also track song *discovery*: each new song songrec
identifies is a `discover` event, drift-corrections are `relock`, and lyrics
served from the local cache are `cache_hit` — so you can see how often radio
re-locked known songs offline.

## Offline behaviour and song identification

- **Known song, no cluster**: after a song has been played once, its lyrics live
  in the local SQLite cache. Radio/live modes replay it with no cluster and no
  LRCLIB request.
- **Unknown song**: identification still uses `songrec`, which queries Shazam
  **online**. There is no offline audio-fingerprint match (that would need
  AcoustID/Chromaprint); the local cache stores recognition *results*, not
  fingerprints.

## Sound check

Before a live session, verify the audio + identify + lyrics stack:

```bash
make test-audio          # pactl devices, songrec, LRCLIB reachability
make mic-test            # live mic VU meter (SECS=4 to change duration)
```

### Live audio sync (mic / room)

`karaoke --listen` (mic) or `--output` (this machine's audio) identify the song
via songrec AND read its Shazam `offset` (position in the track at match time).
The player anchors that offset to a monotonic clock, so lyrics scroll in sync
with whatever is playing in the room — no keypress, no Spotify needed. Offsets
from several matches are clustered (median of the tightest group) to reject the
occasional chorus-repeat outlier. Use `--offset <secs>` to nudge for latency if
lines run early/late.

**Live nudge controls** (in `--radio`, `--listen`, `--output` players): the
song-recognition step listens for ~10s before returning a position, which can
leave the highlighted line running a couple of lines behind the audio. Correct
it on the fly without restarting:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `b` | lyrics are **behind** → jump the highlight **forward** one line |
| `v` | lyrics are **ahead** → step the highlight **back** one line |
| `0` | reset the nudge to the `--offset` baseline |
| `q` | quit |

Each press snaps the highlight exactly one line and the accumulated nudge is
shown in the footer (e.g. `nudge +6.2s`), so it sticks for the rest of the song.
`--offset <secs>` still sets the starting bias if you already know the lag.

**Default forward lead**: because that ~10s recognition window biases the
reported position low, mic/radio locks now start with a **+12.6s forward
pre-bias** baked in (`DEFAULT_LEAD_S`), so the highlight lands close to the audio
without tapping `b` at all. Tune or disable it with `--lead <secs>` (e.g.
`--lead 0` for the raw offset, `--lead 8` for a smaller push). `--lead` stacks on
top of `--offset`; the `0` key resets the live nudge back to this baseline.

### Word-level highlight

The active line highlights the **current word in purple** (magenta) on top of the
blue line background. LRCLIB only timestamps whole lines, so the word playhead is
interpolated: the line's on-screen duration (until the next line's timestamp, or
a 4s tail for the last line) is spread evenly across its words. It's an estimate,
not per-word karaoke timing, but it gives a natural left-to-right sweep to sing
along to. Falls back cleanly on blank lines.

### Spotify position sync

`karaoke --spotify` reads the track currently playing on Spotify and scrolls the
lyrics locked to the **real playback position** (polls progress + interpolates),
so lines advance in time with the audio — no keypress needed. It reuses the OAuth
credentials Hermes already stored in `~/.hermes/auth.json` (no separate login).
Spotify's API forbids audio download, so these tracks use LRCLIB lyrics only
(no Whisper); metadata can be indexed for search via the Spotify importer.

### YouTube mode

`karaoke --youtube URL` resolves a YouTube video to its lyrics: [yt-dlp] reads the
video's title/uploader/duration, a smart parser strips promo decorations
(`(Official Music Video)`, `[Lyrics]`, `| Label`, VEVO/`- Topic` uploader noise)
and splits `Artist - Title`, and the result flows through the normal
LRCLIB → cache → synced-render pipeline. Auto-generated `Art - Topic` channels use
the uploader as the artist; `music.youtube.com` track/artist tags are used
verbatim when present. Timing is keypress-started (like `--file`); to sync to
YouTube actually playing through your speakers, use `--output` or `--radio`.

`karaoke-yt URL` is a shorthand console entry for the same flow (the URL is the
positional argument, no `--youtube` flag needed): `karaoke-yt URL -d --transcribe`,
`karaoke-yt URL --print`, etc.

Requires the optional extra: `pip install -e ".[youtube]"` (or `pip install yt-dlp`).
Unlike Spotify, YouTube audio *can* be fetched — `--youtube URL --download` saves
the audio so the Whisper fallback and librosa beat detection work on videos with
no LRCLIB match. Downloads go to `~/.local/share/karaoke/youtube/` by default and
are auto-pruned after each download to `KARAOKE_YT_CACHE_MAX_MB` (default 500 MiB;
set to `0` to disable). You can inspect or clean the cache manually:

```bash
karaoke-yt --cache-status          # count + MiB + directory
karaoke-yt --prune-cache 100       # delete oldest audio until <= 100 MiB
karaoke-yt --clear-cache           # delete all downloaded YouTube audio
karaoke-yt URL -d --cache-max-mb 50 # per-run cap override
```

Downloading is a YouTube ToS gray area; metadata-only is the default.

#### YouTube Premium / library access (cookies)

If you have YouTube Music Premium, you can authenticate the fetch with your
logged-in session to get higher-bitrate audio (better Whisper/beat results) and
access library-only / private / age-restricted tracks:

```bash
karaoke-yt URL --download --cookies-from-browser firefox   # read cookies live from a browser
karaoke-yt URL --download --cookies ~/yt-cookies.txt        # or an exported cookies.txt
```

The browser spec accepts yt-dlp's full form, e.g. `firefox:PROFILE`,
`chrome+gnomekeyring`, `firefox:prof::Container`. Notes:

- This does **not** use Premium's in-app "Download" — those offline files are
  DRM-locked and unreadable. It authenticates the normal yt-dlp fetch *as you*.
- Automating downloads with your account cookies is against YouTube's ToS and can
  get an account flagged with heavy use. Fine for occasional karaoke; your call.
  Anonymous, metadata-only stays the default.

### Desktop player (MPRIS)

`karaoke --player` (or `-p`) gets the current song from any MPRIS-compatible
desktop media player (Spotify, VLC, web browsers playing media, etc.) via the
`playerctl` command-line tool.

This is a one-shot lookup; if the song changes, re-run the command. It's a
convenient way to avoid typing the artist and title for a song already playing
on your desktop. You may need to `emerge media-sound/playerctl` if it's not
already installed.
