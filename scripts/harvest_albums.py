"""Learn album metadata from YouTube Music's *song* entries.

The cheap sources are exhausted: ffprobe measured the cached audio, Spotify
answered for tracks it knows, and yt-dlp filled in durations from the stored
video ids. Album was still missing for most rows, and the reason turns out to
be *which id is stored*.

The library stores the id that was played, which is normally the music video.
YouTube Music treats a video and a song as different entries, and only the song
carries an album — its menu even offers "go to album", which a video's does not.
Asking yt-dlp about the stored id gets ``album=NA``; asking YouTube Music for
the same song gets the album::

    stored video  naW6-WxmMiU  -> album=NA          (label's video upload)
    YT Music song iZ_SwfLlpHo  -> album=Nevermind   (the song entry)

So this searches YouTube Music per track and reads the first song's metadata:
one yt-dlp call, about 1.6s, no playback and no audio. An earlier version drove
the player and read MPRIS instead, which was slower, made noise, and returned
nothing — a browser tab showing a video has no album to report.

The result is **verified against what was asked for** before being stored. A
search can drift to a different song, and writing its album against this track
would be a silent, permanent mistake. Nothing overwrites a stored value.

Run:  ``python scripts/harvest_albums.py --limit 5``
      ``python scripts/harvest_albums.py --limit 400 --apply``
